How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I knew that the previous version worked correctly so the bug must have been new to that version

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	I could use the strategy from above for all bugs that have been introduced

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually means that I could forget to do it. Automatically means that it might save a version that is incomplete.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because a single change could easily affect multiple files, whereas a change in a Google Doc probably wouldn't affect other docs

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will show me all changes made so I can track down in what version something might have broken
	git diff will show me the differences between the 2 versions so I can understand how it broke

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I know that I have something safe to go back to and I can easily go back to it

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
