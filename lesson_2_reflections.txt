What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates a hidden directory for the repository to reside

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	There may be several files needed for a single commit, but as each one is completed it can be moved in. Also other files may have been started but might not make sense for this commit, so those can be left out.
