What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates a hidden directory for the repository to reside

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	There may be several files needed for a single commit, but as each one is completed it can be moved in. Also other files may have been started but might not make sense for this commit, so those can be left out. 
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	
	After adding commits to the staging area, run 'git diff --staged' to see all of the changes together before committing
	
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	
	When trying something experimental that I don't want to affect the rest of my code. Or when needing to stabilize a particular feature set and work out the bugs while development is on-going on master. 
	
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	
	They are like branches of a tree. Each branch can trace back to the trunk and then to the ground. 

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

	All of the commits made on both branches since they diverged are retained.
