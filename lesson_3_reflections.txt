When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  A remote repository would be helpful if I was collaborating with other developers or if I simply wanted my repository to be accessible from multiple devices. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  I may be working on a feature that is not yet complete and could be buggy. Therefore I don't want to interrupt other developers work by introducing bugs until I have had time to complete the feature.
